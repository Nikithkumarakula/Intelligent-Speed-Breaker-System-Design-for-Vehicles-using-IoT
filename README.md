## **Abstract**
In India, bad visibility conditions like fog or nighttime driving often cause road accidents. The **Intelligent Speed Breaker System** detects upcoming speed breakers and warns drivers using RF modules. It also reduces vehicle speed automatically if the driver fails to take timely action. GPS integration allows for storing speed breaker locations in the cloud, paving the way for smarter road networks.

## **Features**
- **Driver Warning**: Alerts drivers about speed breakers using RF signals.  
- **Automatic Speed Control**: Slows the vehicle automatically if no action is taken.  
- **Cloud Integration**: Logs GPS locations of speed breakers for future analysis.  
- **Manual & Automatic Modes**: Can operate in either mode as per the requirement.

## **Applications**
- **Highways**: Warns fast-moving vehicles about upcoming speed breakers.  
- **School Zones**: Enhances safety for children crossing roads.  
- **Hospitals**: Ensures smooth traffic in hospital zones.  
- **Public Areas**: Provides additional safety in crowded regions.

## **How It Works**
1. **Speed Breaker Detection**  
   - RF transmitter at the speed breaker sends signals.  
   - RF receiver on the vehicle receives the signal, indicating the presence of a speed breaker.  

2. **Vehicle Speed Control**  
   - If the driver doesnâ€™t slow down, the NodeMCU triggers the relay module to reduce vehicle speed.  
   - A buzzer alerts the driver.  

3. **Cloud Storage**  
   - GPS locations of speed breakers are logged to the cloud using IoT integration.

## **Advantages**
- **Accident Prevention**: Reduces the risk of accidents in danger zones.  
- **Safety Enhancement**: Ensures high safety in critical areas like school zones and highways.  
- **Low Maintenance**: Designed for cost-effective and reliable operation.  
- **Scalable Solution**: Supports both manual and automatic driving modes.

## **Results**
- Successfully reduces vehicle speed in real-time upon detecting speed breakers.  
- Logs speed breaker GPS locations accurately for future use.  

---

## **Future Scope**
- Integrate with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).  
- Employ machine learning for predictive accident prevention.  
- Expand to urban planning for intelligent road networks.
